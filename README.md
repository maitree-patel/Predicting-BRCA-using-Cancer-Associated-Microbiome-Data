# Predicting-BRCA-using-Cancer-Associated-Microbiome-Data

## Main Objective
The main aim of this project is to investigate whether microbiome data can discriminate between breast cancer versus normal samples using machine learning (*name the classification model after comparison*). Additionally, using the One Rule (OneR) classification model, the analysis seeks to answer whether a particular microbial taxa is significantly associated with BRCA. And therefore is it overrepresented in a population and hence more susceptible to BRCA.

The specific goals include:
1. Merging the the full raw counts data matrix with the metadata from Poore *et al*
2. Data preprocessing that include data manipulation, filtering and normalization
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize and summarize the data
4. Build classification model
    a. Compare model performance using logistic regression and random forest
6. Perform prediction
7. Model evaluation using cross-fold validation and permiutations; and visualize resulting ROC curves
8. Perform statistical test to analyse difference between BRCA and normal samples
